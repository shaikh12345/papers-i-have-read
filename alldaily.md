DOne with Farrens lectures, but boy Appendix C was so long that I covered only 30/90 pages. :D
Watched [cs231n lecture 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2IwlUtbCFE). Dint quite understand the paper [Instance-sensitive Fully Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08678) 

>Is IOT inspired from TOI?

Tomorrow: 
- [ ] paper on gitless


###22 Oct, 2016 -- Methi Dal and Methi egg Saturday!
---------------
I was reading the [Neural Turing Machine](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5401v2.pdf) paper, halfway through.
Ongoing [Linear Algebra](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf) review plus completed Farrens lecture one.

>Arboretum and classic Hindi songs - Ahahahahah ah!

Tomorrow:
- [ ] Farrens lecture two
- [ ] Neural Turing Machine paper complete
- [ ] ECS 289G read one paper



###21 Oct, 2016
---------------
Discussed [node2vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00653) and watched [cs231n lecture 1] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9rwI_LZX8&list=PL16j5WbGpaM0_Tj8CRmurZ8Kk1gEBc7fg)

>And  as Richard Feynman said:
> What I cannot create, I do not understand.

Future To-do:
- [ ] Read word2vec paper
- [ ] cs231n lecture 2
- [ ] Neural Turing Machine paper
