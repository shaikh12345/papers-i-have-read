Bhiksha's [introductory lecture](http://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/slides.2016/Intro.pdf) on deep learning was a nice read. 
Maybe I should start learning Chinese and coco shoud start looking for another university. ;)

>Delayed Gratification! I should take Psychology classes.

Tomorrow:
- [ ] Word2Vec lecture 2 by Ali Ghodsi
- [ ] Learning Deep Architectures for AI, Yoshua Bengio

### 26 Oct, 2016
---------------
watched [Word2Vec lecture 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsEGsdVJjuA&t=2s) by Ali Ghodsi. 
Completed reading through [gitless](http://people.csail.mit.edu/sperezde/oopsla16.pdf) paper and Reviewed C3D(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.0767v4.pdf) in lab, in the couch! :)

>Shwey and polaroid camera! I said to you if you wanna take photo, let the light fall on object and you dint listen, I am kinda sad.


### 25/24 Oct, 2016 -- Tiring swimming tuesday!
---------------
while monday was spent for comp arch quiz and review of [Instance-sensitive Fully Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08678v1.pdf) which I DID NOT understand.

### 23 Oct, 2016
---------------
DOne with Farrens lectures, but boy Appendix C was so long that I covered only 30/90 pages. :D
Watched [cs231n lecture 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2IwlUtbCFE). Dint quite understand the paper [Instance-sensitive Fully Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08678) 

>Is IOT inspired from TOI?

Tomorrow: 
- [ ] paper on gitless


###22 Oct, 2016 -- Methi Dal and Methi egg Saturday!
---------------
I was reading the [Neural Turing Machine](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5401v2.pdf) paper, halfway through.
Ongoing [Linear Algebra](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf) review plus completed Farrens lecture one.

>Arboretum and classic Hindi songs - Ahahahahah ah!

Tomorrow:
- [ ] Farrens lecture two
- [ ] Neural Turing Machine paper complete
- [ ] ECS 289G read one paper



### 21 Oct, 2016
---------------
Discussed [node2vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00653) and watched [cs231n lecture 1] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp9rwI_LZX8&list=PL16j5WbGpaM0_Tj8CRmurZ8Kk1gEBc7fg)

>And  as Richard Feynman said:
> What I cannot create, I do not understand.

Future To-do:
- [ ] Read word2vec paper
- [ ] cs231n lecture 2
- [ ] Neural Turing Machine paper
