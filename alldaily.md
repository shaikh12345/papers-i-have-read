###22 Oct, 2016 -- Methi Dal and Methi egg Saturday!
---------------
I was reading the [Neural Turing Machine](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5401v2.pdf) paper, halfway through.
Ongoing [Linear Algebra](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf) review plus completed Farrens lecture one.

>Arboretum and classic Hindi songs - Ahahahahah ah!

Tomorrow:
- [ ] Farrens lecture two
- [ ] Neural Turing Machine paper complete
- [ ] ECS 289G read one paper
